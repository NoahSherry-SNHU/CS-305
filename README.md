Repository for CS-305: Software Security

## 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  My client for this class was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Artemis Financial were seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications.

## 2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  I feel that I was particularly good at identifying false positives when checking for vulnerabilities in the client's project. It's important to code securely so that you reduce the chance of exposing the code to vulnerabilites later in the project lifecycle. Software Security adds safety and protection to a company's wellbeing, as well as giving them peace of mind that their information is safe and secure.

## 3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  I found that correctly assessing the areas of vulnerability for the report was quite challenging. To some extent, I feel that every area is important in every project, but that wasn't quite what the assignment was asking for.

## 4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  I chose some of the most vulnerable layers in the client's project and fortified those layers to increase the strength of the code's weakest link. In the future, I'll likely make more use of online CVE databases myself to find solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## 5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ensured the code and application were functional and secure by performing rigorous static and dynamic testing on the code to ensure every use case was handled and that none of the dependencies could be exploited. After refactoring the code, I ran through the same test cases to make sure everything was still safe and operational.

## 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I found the Maven Dependency checker tool to be extremely useful and will definitely use it in the future.

## 7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  I might consider showcasing my use of Dependency checkers to a future employer to show that I am competent with finding vulnerabilities within a codebase.
